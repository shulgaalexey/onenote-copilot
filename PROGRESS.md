# OneNote Copilot - Implementation Progress

## Current Task: Enforce TEST_RUN.md Approach
**Date**: July 16, 2025
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

### Objective
Review all `.md` files in the repository and explicitly enforce the usage of `TEST_RUN.md` for pytest output redirection to ensure Copilot Agent doesn't jump to the next command before the previous one finishes.

### Current Context
The project uses a mandatory `TEST_RUN.md` approach where:
- All pytest output gets redirected to `TEST_RUN.md`
- Tests append `%TESTS FINISHED%` marker when complete
- Agent must monitor this file and wait for completion marker
- Maximum wait time: 5 minutes before investigating

### Files Updated âœ…
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` âœ… - Enhanced with stronger warnings and updated legacy commands
- `prompts/commands/long_running_tests.md` âœ… - Completely rewritten with comprehensive TEST_RUN.md guidance
- `prompts/PLANNING.md` âœ… - Added dedicated TEST_RUN.md section and updated legacy commands
- `prompts/TASK.md` âœ… - Added testing workflow section with TEST_RUN.md approach
- `prompts/commands/execute-prp.md` âœ… - Updated validation section to mandate TEST_RUN.md
- `prompts/commands/generate-prp.md` âœ… - Updated validation gates to include TEST_RUN.md
- `prompts/commands/refactor-code.md` âœ… - Added TEST_RUN.md requirement to incremental execution
- `prompts/PRPs/OneNote_Copilot_CLI.md` âœ… - Updated validation section with TEST_RUN.md approach
- `README.md` âœ… - Added comprehensive testing section with TEST_RUN.md prominence
- `prompts/commands/TEST_RUN_APPROACH.md` âœ… - Created standalone comprehensive guide

### Key Improvements Implemented âœ…
1. Made `TEST_RUN.md` approach more prominent and explicit in all files
2. Added specific PowerShell commands with redirection and completion markers
3. Emphasized patience and waiting for completion marker throughout documentation
4. Provided troubleshooting steps for long-running tests in multiple locations
5. Added validation checkpoints that require TEST_RUN.md monitoring
6. Updated all legacy pytest commands to use the TEST_RUN.md approach
7. Created comprehensive standalone TEST_RUN_APPROACH.md guide
8. Enhanced warnings and explanations about why this approach is critical

### Summary
All `.md` files in the repository have been reviewed and updated to consistently enforce the `TEST_RUN.md` approach. The documentation now prominently features:

- ðŸš¨ Warning icons and "MANDATORY" labels
- Clear PowerShell commands with completion markers
- Explanations of why this prevents premature command execution
- Troubleshooting guidance for long-running tests
- Consistent messaging across all documentation files

The Copilot Agent should now have clear, consistent guidance to always use the TEST_RUN.md approach and wait for completion markers before proceeding to subsequent commands.
