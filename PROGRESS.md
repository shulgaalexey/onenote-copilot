- âœ… **Windows Compatibility**: Handles file locking issues gracefully
- âœ… **Log Rotation**: 10MB files with 5 backup copies using RotatingFileHandler
- âœ… **Unicode Support**: Full UTF-8 encoding for international characters
- âœ… **Decorator Support**: @logged and @logged_with_args for automatic logging

### Technical Implementation
1. âœ… **Created logging configuration module** in `src/config/logging.py`
2. âœ… **Updated settings** to include comprehensive logging configuration
3. âœ… **Integrated with main application** startup and error handling
4. âœ… **Added logging to core modules** (main, auth, agents, CLI)
5. âœ… **Created comprehensive test suite** with 23 test cases

### Key Features
- **File Location**: Logs saved to `logs/onenote_copilot.log` in project root
- **Dual Output**: Console (Rich formatted) + File (structured with timestamps)
- **Log Levels**: Console respects user settings, File always captures DEBUG
- **External Library Control**: Suppresses noisy libraries (httpx, msal, urllib3) unless debug mode
- **API Call Logging**: Tracks HTTP requests with URLs, status codes, and response times
- **Performance Metrics**: Function execution timing with context parameters
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception logging with stack traces in debug mode

### Testing Results

## Previous Task: Fix OneNote API Search Error âœ… COMPLETED
**Date**: July 16, 2025
**Status**: âœ… FIXED & TESTED

### Issue Summary
- **Error**: API request failed with status 400: "Your request contains unsupported OData query parameters"
- **Root Cause**: OneNote pages API does NOT support `$search` parameter for text search
- **Discovery**: Microsoft Graph Search API does not include OneNote as a supported entity type

### Solution Implemented
**New Approach**: Hybrid search strategy using supported OData parameters
1. **Title Search**: Uses `$filter` with `contains(tolower(title), 'query')` function
2. **Content Search Fallback**: When title search yields < 3 results, fetches recent pages and searches content locally
3. **Security**: Properly escapes single quotes to prevent injection attacks
4. **Efficiency**: Progressive search - starts with title, expands to content if needed

### Technical Changes Made
- âœ… **Updated `OneNoteSearchTool._search_pages_api()`**: Changed from `$search` to `$filter` parameter
- âœ… **Added `OneNoteSearchTool._search_pages_by_content()`**: New fallback method for content search
- âœ… **Enhanced Query Processing**: Improved `_prepare_search_query()` for title-based filtering
- âœ… **Added Security**: Quote escaping to prevent OData injection
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 2 new unit tests to verify the fix

### Testing Results
- âœ… **16/16 tests passed** - All existing functionality preserved
- âœ… **New API parameter test** - Verifies `$filter` usage instead of `$search`
- âœ… **Quote escaping test** - Verifies security against injection attacks
- âœ… **Application starts successfully** - No more 400 errors on initialization

### Next Steps
- ðŸ”„ **Ready for User Testing**: Application should now handle search queries without API errors
- ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor search performance with the new hybrid approach
- ðŸ§ª **Real-world Validation**: Test with actual OneNote content to verify search quality

### Examples of Query Processing
- "What did I write about vibe coding?" â†’ "write vibe coding"
- "Show me notes about Python" â†’ "notes Python"
- "Find my notes on machine learning" â†’ "my notes machine learning"

### Changes Made
- âœ… Added `_prepare_search_query` method to process natural language queries
- âœ… Updated `search_pages` method to use processed queries
- âœ… Added metadata tracking for both original and processed queries
- âœ… Tested query processing with various natural language inputs

### Next Steps
- Test the full application flow with the fix
- Verify search results are relevant with processed queries
- Consider additional query enhancement features

## Previous Task: Fix /notebooks and /recent Command Errors
**Date**: July 16, 2025
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### Issues Identified
1. **`/notebooks` error**: `'dict' object has no attribute 'messages'` - the `list_notebooks` method is returning incorrect data
2. **`/recent` error**: `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` - JSON parsing error in the workflow
3. **Root cause**: The CLI command handlers are calling agent methods that try to use LangGraph workflow incorrectly

### Changes Made
- âœ… Modified `list_notebooks` and `get_recent_pages` in OneNote agent to call search tool directly
- âœ… Added better error handling and validation in both methods
- âœ… Added debug output to CLI interface to help troubleshoot issues
- âœ… Improved error reporting in CLI command handlers

### Next Steps
- Test the commands with the improved error handling
- Remove debug output once issues are resolved
- Verify both commands work correctly with real data

### Fix Strategy
- Bypass LangGraph workflow for simple command operations
- Use direct search tool calls for better reliability
- Add comprehensive error handling to prevent CLI crashes

### Previous Task: Enforce TEST_RUN.md Approach
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

### Objective
Review all `.md` files in the repository and explicitly enforce the usage of `TEST_RUN.md` for pytest output redirection to ensure Copilot Agent doesn't jump to the next command before the previous one finishes.

### Current Context
The project uses a mandatory `TEST_RUN.md` approach where:
- All pytest output gets redirected to `TEST_RUN.md`
- Tests append `%TESTS FINISHED%` marker when complete
- Agent must monitor this file and wait for completion marker
- Maximum wait time: 5 minutes before investigating

### Files Updated âœ…
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` âœ… - Enhanced with stronger warnings and updated legacy commands
- `prompts/commands/long_running_tests.md` âœ… - Completely rewritten with comprehensive TEST_RUN.md guidance
- `prompts/PLANNING.md` âœ… - Added dedicated TEST_RUN.md section and updated legacy commands
- `prompts/TASK.md` âœ… - Added testing workflow section with TEST_RUN.md approach
- `prompts/commands/execute-prp.md` âœ… - Updated validation section to mandate TEST_RUN.md
- `prompts/commands/generate-prp.md` âœ… - Updated validation gates to include TEST_RUN.md
- `prompts/commands/refactor-code.md` âœ… - Added TEST_RUN.md requirement to incremental execution
- `prompts/PRPs/OneNote_Copilot_CLI.md` âœ… - Updated validation section with TEST_RUN.md approach
- `README.md` âœ… - Added comprehensive testing section with TEST_RUN.md prominence
- `prompts/commands/TEST_RUN_APPROACH.md` âœ… - Created standalone comprehensive guide

### Key Improvements Implemented âœ…
1. Made `TEST_RUN.md` approach more prominent and explicit in all files
2. Added specific PowerShell commands with redirection and completion markers
3. Emphasized patience and waiting for completion marker throughout documentation
4. Provided troubleshooting steps for long-running tests in multiple locations
5. Added validation checkpoints that require TEST_RUN.md monitoring
6. Updated all legacy pytest commands to use the TEST_RUN.md approach
7. Created comprehensive standalone TEST_RUN_APPROACH.md guide
8. Enhanced warnings and explanations about why this approach is critical

### Summary
All `.md` files in the repository have been reviewed and updated to consistently enforce the `TEST_RUN.md` approach. The documentation now prominently features:

- ðŸš¨ Warning icons and "MANDATORY" labels
- Clear PowerShell commands with completion markers
- Explanations of why this prevents premature command execution
- Troubleshooting guidance for long-running tests
- Consistent messaging across all documentation files

The Copilot Agent should now have clear, consistent guidance to always use the TEST_RUN.md approach and wait for completion markers before proceeding to subsequent commands.
