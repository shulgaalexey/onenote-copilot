# Progress Log

## 2025-07-17: Fixed Agent Query Pattern Recognition ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Task**: Fix agent not recognizing follow-up queries as search requests
- **Current PRP**: Debugging agent decision logic for tool calling
- **Context**: First query works perfectly, second query gets stuck with "Direct response without tools"
- **Root Cause**: `_needs_tool_call()` method missing key query patterns
- **Issue Analysis**:
  - ‚úÖ First query: "What are my ideas about the Vibe Coding?" ‚Üí Matches "ideas about" pattern ‚Üí Tool call triggered
  - ‚ùå Second query: "How did I organise preparations to the interviews?" ‚Üí No pattern match ‚Üí No tool call
  - Problem: Missing patterns like "how did i", "organise", "prepare", "interview" etc.
- **Fix Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ **Enhanced Search Indicators**: Added missing patterns to `search_indicators` list:
    ```python
    # Added patterns:
    "how did i", "what did i", "tell me about", "explain", "describe",
    "what about", "information about", "details about", "data about",
    "anything about", "stuff about", "material about", "content on",
    "organise", "organize", "prepare", "preparation", "plan", "planning",
    "approach", "method", "strategy", "process", "procedure", "steps"
    ```
  - ‚úÖ **Enhanced Semantic Indicators**: Added work-related patterns to `semantic_indicators`:
    ```python
    # Added patterns:
    "how did i", "how i", "organise", "organize", "prepare", "preparation",
    "plan", "planning", "process", "procedure", "method", "steps",
    "interview", "interviews", "meeting", "meetings", "work"
    ```
- **Expected Result**: Agent should now properly recognize queries like "How did I organise..." as search requests
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Ready for testing

## 2025-07-17: Fixed Agent Response Generation After Search ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Task**: Fix agent failing to yield final response after successful search results
- **Current PRP**: Debugging agent event processing and response generation
- **Context**: Search working properly, finding "Vibe Coding" content, but agent not generating user response
- **Root Cause**: Agent event processing loop missing `semantic_search` event handling
- **Issue Found from Logs**:
  - ‚úÖ Search finds content: "Content search found 1 matching pages", "Hybrid search found 1 combined results"
  - ‚ùå Agent fails: "No final response yielded during normal processing, attempting fallback"
  - Missing: `semantic_search` event not handled in main event processing loop
- **Fix Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ **Updated Event Handling**: Added `semantic_search` to the list of tool events in `_process_query` method
  - ‚úÖ **Event Recognition**: Modified tool execution detection to include `semantic_search` events
  - ‚úÖ **Tool Flag Setting**: Ensures `tool_executed = True` when semantic search completes
- **Expected Flow**:
  1. User query ‚Üí semantic_search node ‚Üí SEARCH_RESULTS: response
  2. Agent node processes SEARCH_RESULTS ‚Üí generates final user response
  3. Event loop recognizes tool completion ‚Üí yields final response
- **Code Change**:
  ```python
  # Before: ["search_onenote", "get_recent_pages", "get_notebooks"]
  # After:  ["search_onenote", "get_recent_pages", "get_notebooks", "semantic_search"]
  ```
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Agent should now properly process semantic search results and generate responses

## 2025-07-17: Improved Search for "Vibe Coding" Content ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Task**: Improve search functionality to find "Vibe-coding" content that user reported as existing
- **Current PRP**: Enhancing search query processing and similarity matching
- **Context**: User reported that "Vibe-coding" is literally a section title in OneNote but search returned 0 results
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - ‚úÖ Search was working but query processing was too restrictive
  - ‚úÖ Found actual content: "The app was created using vibe coding..." in "Robo-me" page
  - ‚úÖ Issue was "the Vibe Coding" vs "vibe coding" mismatch and strict similarity threshold
- **Improvements Implemented**:
  - ‚úÖ **Better Query Processing**: Remove articles ("the", "a", "an") from extracted subjects
  - ‚úÖ **Enhanced Query Variations**: Generate individual words, pairs, and combinations from compound terms
  - ‚úÖ **Lowered Similarity Threshold**: Reduced from 0.6 to 0.4 for more permissive semantic matching
  - ‚úÖ **Improved Search Logic**: Better handling of thought-related queries like "What are my ideas about..."
- **Results**:
  - ‚úÖ Query "What are my ideas about the Vibe Coding?" now processes as "Vibe Coding"
  - ‚úÖ Generates variations: ['What are my ideas about the Vibe Coding', 'Vibe Coding', 'are my ideas vibe coding', 'are', 'ideas', 'vibe', 'coding', 'are my', 'my ideas', 'ideas vibe', 'vibe coding']
  - ‚úÖ Successfully finds content: "Robo-me: The app was created using vibe coding..."
- **Verification**: Direct search for "vibe" and "coding" now successfully returns relevant content
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Search functionality now properly finds "Vibe Coding" related content

## 2025-07-17: Fixed 're' Variable Error in OneNote Search ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Task**: Fix "cannot access local variable 're'" error in OneNote search functionality
- **Current PRP**: Debugging search functionality failures
- **Context**: User queries were failing with local variable 're' error in `src.tools.onenote_search`
- **Root Cause**: Redundant `import re` statements inside methods when `re` was already imported at file level
- **Issues Found and Fixed**:
  - ‚úÖ Removed redundant `import re` in `_generate_query_variations()` method (line 166)
  - ‚úÖ Removed redundant `import re` in `_extract_text_from_html()` method (line 609)
- **Verification**:
  - ‚úÖ Query variations generation works: `['What are my ideas about the Vibe Coding', 'the Vibe Coding', 'are my ideas vibe coding', 'coding']`
  - ‚úÖ HTML text extraction works: `Test HTML content`
  - ‚úÖ Import tests pass successfully
- **Status**: COMPLETED - OneNote search should now work without 're' variable errors

## 2025-07-17: Implementing Full Index Command ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Task**: Implement full content indexing functionality for `/index` command
- **Current PRP**: Working on semantic search indexing functionality
- **Context**: User can run `/index recent` but `/index` shows "not yet implemented" message
- **Goal**: Add capability to index all OneNote pages for comprehensive semantic search
- **Implementation Completed**:
  - ‚úÖ Created `get_all_pages()` method in OneNoteSearchTool to fetch all pages from all notebooks
  - ‚úÖ Updated CLI interface to use full indexing when no parameters provided
  - ‚úÖ Added progress reporting and error handling for large indexing operations
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced `index_pages()` method to return detailed statistics (successful, failed, total_chunks)
  - ‚úÖ Updated help text to clarify `/index` vs `/index recent` commands
  - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive tests for new functionality
  - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Rich Live Display conflict error ("Only one live display may be active at once")
- **Features Added**:
  - Full content indexing with pagination support (handles large notebooks)
  - Batch processing with configurable limits (default 100 pages for CLI)
  - Detailed progress reporting during indexing
  - Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
  - Enhanced result reporting with success/failure counts and chunk statistics
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved nested Rich status context issue that was causing the "Only one live display" error
- **Status**: COMPLETED - `/index` command now performs full content indexing without errors

## 2025-07-17: Fixing Indexing Commands - OpenAI Client Context Manager Issue ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Task**: Fix `/reset-index` and `/index` commands failing due to OpenAI client context manager error
- **Current PRP**: Working on semantic search indexing functionality
- **Context**: Content fetching now works (pages have content), but embedding generation fails with "'NoneType' object does not support the context manager protocol"
- **Key Issues Found from Logs**:
  - Content fetching is successful: pages now have chunks generated (1-3 chunks per page)
  - OpenAI embedding generation fails: "NoneType' object does not support the context manager protocol"
  - All pages fail to index due to embedding generation errors
  - Vector store collection reset fails: "Collection [onenote_content] already exists"
- **Root Cause**: OpenAI client initialization or context manager usage issue in embeddings module
- **Fixes Implemented**:
  - ‚úÖ Fixed OpenAI embedding generation: Removed incorrect `with log_api_call()` context manager usage
  - ‚úÖ Fixed vector store reset: Set `allow_reset=True` in ChromaDB settings and improved reset logic
  - ‚úÖ Added proper error handling for collection existence edge cases
- **Test Results**: All tests passed successfully:
  - Single embedding generation: ‚úÖ 1536 dimensions
  - Batch embedding generation: ‚úÖ 3 embeddings
  - Vector store reset: ‚úÖ Successful
  - Full indexing pipeline: ‚úÖ 3 total chunks generated from 3 pages
- **Status**: COMPLETED - `/reset-index` and `/index` commands should now work correctly

## 2025-07-17: Search Query Analysis - Why "interview" Search Failed üîç FIXES IMPLEMENTED
- **Task**: Analyze and fix search issues preventing finding content with "interview" keyword
- **Current PRP**: Debugging semantic search functionality based on user query failure
- **Context**: User query "What did I write about the interviews?" returned 0 results despite OneNote having content with "interview" keyword
- **Key Issues Found from Log Analysis**:
  1. **Overly Aggressive Query Processing**: `_prepare_search_query()` removes too many words
     - Original: "What did I write about the interviews?"
     - Processed: "write the interviews" (removed "what did i" and "about")
     - This makes the query too specific and misses semantic matches
  2. **High Semantic Similarity Threshold**: Using 0.75 threshold may be too restrictive
     - Vector store search: "Found 0 similar embeddings (threshold: 0.75)"
     - Need to test with lower thresholds (0.6-0.65)
  3. **Vector Store Content Unknown**: Need to verify what content is actually indexed
     - Collection exists with data but need to verify content quality and relevance
  4. **API Search Also Failed**: Both semantic and keyword searches returned 0 results
     - API returned 0 pages for processed query "write the interviews"
     - Content search of 7 recent pages found 0 matches
- **Fixes Implemented**:
  1. ‚úÖ **Improved Query Processing**: Made `_prepare_search_query()` more conservative
     - Removed aggressive question word removal patterns
     - Only removes "about" from beginning, preserves semantic meaning
     - Added `_generate_query_variations()` to try multiple query forms
  2. ‚úÖ **Lowered Semantic Threshold**: Changed from 0.75 to 0.6 in settings
     - Should improve recall for semantic searches
     - Better balance between precision and recall
  3. ‚úÖ **Added Query Variation Fallback**: Enhanced search logic
     - When no results found, try multiple query variations automatically
     - Extracts content words and tries different combinations
     - Better chance of finding relevant content
- **Status**: Ready for testing - fixes should improve search success for natural language queries

## 2025-07-17: Logging Optimization for Better Debugging
- **Task**: Review and optimize logging configuration to reduce verbosity and improve usefulness
- **Current PRP**: Working on logging improvements based on actual log file analysis
- **Context**: Log file shows excessive noise from external libraries (httpcore, markdown_it) making debugging difficult
- **Key Issues Found**:
  - httpcore library flooding logs with TCP connection details
  - markdown_it library logging every parsing step at DEBUG level
  - 1500+ lines of mostly low-level library details obscuring actual application logic
  - Unicode emoji characters causing encoding errors on Windows
- **Changes Implemented**:
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced external library filtering with comprehensive list of noisy loggers
  - ‚úÖ Added NoiseFilter class to completely exclude certain log patterns from file output
  - ‚úÖ Improved performance logging with readable duration formatting and contextual information
  - ‚úÖ Replaced Unicode emojis with plain text prefixes for Windows compatibility
  - ‚úÖ Added dynamic component debug control functions for targeted debugging
  - ‚úÖ More concise file formatter for better readability
- **Results**: Log output reduced from 1500+ lines to ~13 focused, informative lines
- **New Features**:
  - `enable_component_debug(component)` / `disable_component_debug(component)` for targeted debugging
  - Better performance logging with [FAST]/[NORM]/[SLOW] indicators and context
  - Complete filtering of httpcore TCP details and markdown_it parsing noise
- **Next Steps**: Monitor actual application usage to fine-tune filtering levels
