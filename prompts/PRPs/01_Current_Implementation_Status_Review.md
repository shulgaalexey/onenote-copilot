name: "Current Implementation Status Review: OneNote Copilot Production Assessment"
description: |
  Review and document the current fully-implemented OneNote Copilot CLI application status,
  transitioning from implementation-focused to enhancement-focused development approach.

## Purpose
Document the current state of the completed OneNote Copilot CLI implementation and establish a baseline for future enhancements and optimizations.

## Goal
Assess the production-ready OneNote Copilot CLI application (373 tests passing, 77.01% coverage) and document:
- Current architecture vs original design specifications
- Implementation completeness against PRP requirements
- Quality metrics and production readiness status
- Gap analysis for missing features or improvements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete architecture documentation of current implementation
- [ ] Verification of all original PRP requirements fulfillment
- [ ] Quality assessment report with metrics analysis
- [ ] Identification of enhancement opportunities
- [ ] Updated project status from "implementation" to "production enhancement"

## Tasks
```yaml
Task 1: Architecture Documentation
REVIEW src/ structure:
  - DOCUMENT: Current vs planned architecture alignment
  - VERIFY: All modules and components implemented correctly
  - ASSESS: Code quality against specified patterns

Task 2: Requirements Verification
VALIDATE against original PRP:
  - CONFIRM: All success criteria met
  - CHECK: Authentication, search, CLI functionality working
  - VERIFY: Windows/PowerShell compatibility maintained

Task 3: Quality Metrics Analysis
ANALYZE current metrics:
  - REVIEW: 373 tests passing (100% success rate)
  - ASSESS: 77.01% code coverage gaps
  - EVALUATE: Performance and reliability indicators

Task 4: Enhancement Roadmap
IDENTIFY opportunities:
  - DOCUMENT: Missing 22.99% coverage areas
  - SUGGEST: Performance optimization potential
  - PLAN: User experience improvements
```

## Validation
```powershell
# Current status verification
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing > TEST_RUN.md 2>&1; Add-Content -Path "TEST_RUN.md" -Value "%TESTS FINISHED%"

# Architecture review
tree src/ /f > architecture_review.md

# Quality assessment
ruff check src/ --output-format=json > quality_report.json
mypy src/ --show-error-codes > type_safety_report.md
```

## Confidence Score: 10/10
This is a straightforward assessment task with clear metrics and existing codebase to review.
