name: "Enhancement Opportunity Identification: Optimization and Improvement Analysis"
description: |
  Systematic analysis of the current OneNote Copilot CLI implementation to identify
  specific opportunities for performance optimization, feature enhancement, and user experience improvements.

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive analysis of the production OneNote Copilot CLI to identify concrete improvement opportunities based on code coverage gaps, performance metrics, and user experience patterns.

## Goal
Generate actionable improvement roadmap covering:
- Code coverage gap analysis (missing 22.99% coverage areas)
- Performance optimization opportunities
- User experience enhancement possibilities
- Feature expansion potential based on usage patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Detailed analysis of 22.99% uncovered code areas
- [ ] Performance bottleneck identification with metrics
- [ ] User experience friction points documented
- [ ] Prioritized enhancement backlog created
- [ ] ROI assessment for each improvement opportunity

## Tasks
```yaml
Task 1: Code Coverage Gap Analysis
ANALYZE uncovered code:
  - IDENTIFY: Specific files/functions missing test coverage
  - ASSESS: Risk level of uncovered code paths
  - PRIORITIZE: Critical vs nice-to-have coverage improvements
  - ESTIMATE: Effort required for coverage completion

Task 2: Performance Optimization Analysis
PROFILE current performance:
  - MEASURE: Search response times across different query types
  - IDENTIFY: Memory usage patterns and potential leaks
  - ANALYZE: API call efficiency and caching opportunities
  - ASSESS: CLI rendering performance for large result sets

Task 3: User Experience Enhancement Analysis
EVALUATE user interaction patterns:
  - IDENTIFY: Common user workflow friction points
  - ANALYZE: CLI command usage patterns and pain points
  - ASSESS: Error message clarity and recovery paths
  - EVALUATE: Onboarding experience completeness

Task 4: Feature Enhancement Opportunities
EXPLORE expansion possibilities:
  - RESEARCH: OneNote API capabilities not yet utilized
  - IDENTIFY: Adjacent productivity features for integration
  - ASSESS: AI/ML enhancement opportunities
  - EVALUATE: Collaboration and sharing feature potential
```

## Analysis Outputs
```yaml
REPORTS:
  - coverage_gap_analysis.md: "Detailed coverage improvement plan"
  - performance_optimization_plan.md: "Specific performance improvements"
  - ux_enhancement_roadmap.md: "User experience improvement priorities"
  - feature_expansion_opportunities.md: "New feature possibilities"
```

## Analysis Commands
