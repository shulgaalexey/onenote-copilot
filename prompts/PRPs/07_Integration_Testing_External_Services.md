name: "Integration Testing with External Services: Live API Validation"
description: |
  Comprehensive testing of OneNote Copilot with real Microsoft Graph API services,
  authentication flows, and network conditions to ensure production reliability.

## Purpose
Validate OneNote Copilot functionality against real Microsoft Graph API endpoints, ensuring robust handling of authentication, rate limiting, and network variations.

## Goal
Establish comprehensive integration testing covering:
- Live Microsoft Graph API authentication and token management
- Real OneNote content operations with various account types
- Network failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Rate limiting behavior and retry logic validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All authentication flows work with real Microsoft accounts
- [ ] Search and content retrieval functions correctly with live data
- [ ] Rate limiting and error handling validated under real conditions
- [ ] Network resilience tested across different connection scenarios
- [ ] Performance metrics established for real-world usage

## Tasks
```yaml
Task 1: Live Authentication Testing
CREATE tests/live_auth/:
  - TEST: Personal Microsoft account authentication flow
  - VALIDATE: Token caching and automatic refresh
  - VERIFY: Browser-based OAuth2 flow reliability
  - HANDLE: Authentication failure scenarios

Task 2: Real Data Operations
CREATE tests/live_api/:
  - TEST: Search operations against real OneNote content
  - VALIDATE: Content retrieval and HTML parsing
  - VERIFY: Notebook and section enumeration
  - MEASURE: API response times and data accuracy

Task 3: Network Resilience Testing
CREATE tests/network/:
  - SIMULATE: Intermittent connectivity scenarios
  - TEST: Timeout handling and retry mechanisms
  - VALIDATE: Graceful degradation when offline
  - VERIFY: Recovery behavior when connectivity restored

Task 4: Rate Limiting Validation
CREATE tests/rate_limits/:
  - TEST: Microsoft Graph API rate limit handling
  - VALIDATE: Exponential backoff implementation
  - VERIFY: Queue management during high usage
  - MEASURE: Performance impact of rate limiting
```

## Test Environment Setup
```yaml
REQUIREMENTS:
  - real_microsoft_account: "Test account with OneNote content"
  - network_simulation: "Tools for connection manipulation"
  - monitoring: "API call tracking and timing"

SAFETY_MEASURES:
  - rate_limit_respect: "Never exceed API limits during testing"
  - data_protection: "Use test content only, no production data"
```

## Validation Commands
```powershell
# Live authentication test
python -m tests.live_auth.test_real_auth_flow

# API operations test
python -m tests.live_api.test_real_search_operations

# Network resilience test
python -m tests.network.test_connectivity_scenarios
```

## Confidence Score: 8/10
Well-defined testing scope, complexity in simulating real-world network conditions and ensuring test safety.
