- Enterprise security requirements and credential management
- Automated deployment and update mechanisms
- Monitoring and maintenance procedures

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Windows compatibility matrix documented and tested
- [ ] Enterprise security compliance verified
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline created
- [ ] Monitoring and logging framework established
- [ ] User onboarding and training materials prepared

## Tasks
```yaml
Task 1: Windows Environment Compatibility
CREATE deployment/windows/:
  - TEST: Windows 10/11 compatibility across builds
  - VALIDATE: PowerShell 5.1 and 7.x compatibility
  - VERIFY: Different Python installation scenarios
  - DOCUMENT: System requirements and dependencies

Task 2: Enterprise Security Framework
CREATE deployment/security/:
  - IMPLEMENT: Secure credential storage recommendations
  - VALIDATE: Azure AD integration for enterprise accounts
  - CREATE: Security policy compliance checklist
  - DOCUMENT: Data privacy and compliance procedures

Task 3: Deployment Automation
CREATE deployment/automation/:
  - BUILD: Automated installer for Windows systems

  - ESTABLISH: Support and troubleshooting procedures
```

## Enterprise Requirements
```yaml
SECURITY:
  - credential_management: "Enterprise-grade token storage"
  - compliance: "GDPR, SOC2, enterprise data policies"
  - audit_trail: "User activity logging and reporting"

DEPLOYMENT:
  - scale: "Support for 1000+ user deployments"
  - automation: "Zero-touch installation procedures"
  - management: "Centralized configuration and updates"
```

## Validation Commands
```powershell
# Windows compatibility test
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deployment/test_windows_compatibility.ps1

# Security compliance check
python -m deployment.security.compliance_validator

# Deployment automation test
deployment/automation/test_silent_install.bat
```

## Confidence Score: 7/10
Complex enterprise requirements, significant dependency on specific Windows enterprise tooling and policies.
