# OneNote Copilot - Task Management

This file tracks all project tasks using a priority-based system optimized for solo development with AI assistance.

## Task Priority System

- **P-0 (Immediate)**: Urgent tasks that must be tackled right away
- **P-1 (Sooner than Later)**: Important tasks that are next in line after P-0
- **P-2 (Obligations)**: Tasks with no pressing urgency, catch-all category
- **P-X (Excitements)**: Tasks that genuinely excite and motivate

## Current Sprint - July 2025

### P-0 (Immediate Tasks)
- [x] Complete codebase consistency audit (pip over uv, LangGraph over Pydantic AI)
- [x] Create missing essential project files (README.md, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, .env.example)
- [x] Update all documentation to use pip instead of uv
- [x] Update all references from Pydantic AI to LangGraph
- [x] Create comprehensive PRP for OneNote Copilot CLI implementation

### P-1 (Sooner than Later)
- [ ] Execute OneNote Copilot CLI PRP using GitHub Copilot agent mode
- [ ] Create basic Python project structure with src/ folder
- [ ] Set up LangGraph agent foundation
- [ ] Configure development environment and validate all tools work
- [ ] Create initial OneNote integration exploration

### P-2 (Obligations)
- [ ] Research LangGraph framework and best practices thoroughly
- [ ] Study OneNote API integration patterns
- [ ] Review Microsoft Graph API documentation for OneNote access
- [ ] Plan initial agent architecture for OneNote workflows

### P-X (Excitements)
- [ ] Design and implement first LangGraph agent for OneNote
- [ ] Create PRP for OneNote content analysis agent
- [ ] Build CLI interface for OneNote agent interaction
- [ ] Integrate with Microsoft Graph API for real OneNote access

## Daily Focus Areas

### Today's Do List
- Complete P-0 tasks (immediate priorities)
- Make progress on P-1 tasks
- Review and update task priorities

### Look Forward To
- Working on P-X tasks (exciting features)
- Experimenting with new AI agent patterns
- Building innovative social interaction features

## Discovered During Work

*Tasks and ideas discovered while working on planned tasks will be added here*

### Research Findings
- **LangGraph vs Pydantic AI**: LangGraph provides better stateful multi-agent capabilities and is more mature for complex workflows. Pydantic AI is simpler but less feature-rich for our OneNote integration needs.
- **OneNote API**: Microsoft Graph API provides comprehensive OneNote access through REST endpoints
- **Windows Development**: PowerShell is the preferred shell, pip is more reliable than uv for package management on Windows
- **Agent Architecture**: Graph-based state management is essential for maintaining context across OneNote operations
- **Package Management**: pip provides better compatibility and is the standard Python package manager

### Technical Discoveries
- PowerShell has different command chaining syntax (`;` instead of `&&`)
- Windows virtual environment activation requires `.ps1` scripts
- LangGraph requires graph-based state management patterns throughout the codebase
- Microsoft Graph API integration requires MSAL authentication
- OneNote API has specific permissions requirements for read/write access

## Notes & Context

### Current Focus
Building a robust foundation for AI agent development with proper Windows tooling and GitHub Copilot integration.

### Key Decisions Made
1. Prioritize Windows/PowerShell compatibility over cross-platform support
2. Use GitHub Copilot as primary AI assistant for development
3. Implement comprehensive testing from the start
4. Follow modern Python packaging and dependency management practices

### Blockers & Dependencies
- Need to research Pydantic AI framework thoroughly before agent implementation
- Require virtual environment setup before package installation
- Must complete project structure before beginning feature development

## Workflow Integration

This task file is integrated with:
- **PLANNING.md**: Overall project architecture and guidelines
- **CLAUDE.md**: AI assistant configuration for project context
- **GitHub Copilot**: Agent mode integration for automated implementation
- **PRPs**: Feature specifications and implementation guidelines

## Maintenance

- Review and update priorities weekly
- Move completed tasks to "Completed Tasks ✓" section immediately
- Add new discoveries to "Discovered During Work" section
- Keep daily focus areas updated based on current priorities
