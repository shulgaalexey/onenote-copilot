## Discovered During Work

*Tasks and ideas discovered while working on planned tasks will be added here*

### Research Findings
- **LangGraph vs Pydantic AI**: LangGraph provides better stateful multi-agent capabilities and is more mature for complex workflows. Pydantic AI is simpler but less feature-rich for our OneNote integration needs.
- **OneNote API**: Microsoft Graph API provides comprehensive OneNote access through REST endpoints
- **Windows Development**: PowerShell is the preferred shell, pip is more reliable than uv for package management on Windows
- **Agent Architecture**: Graph-based state management is essential for maintaining context across OneNote operations
- **Package Management**: pip provides better compatibility and is the standard Python package manager

### Technical Discoveries
- PowerShell has different command chaining syntax (`;` instead of `&&`)
- Windows virtual environment activation requires `.ps1` scripts
- LangGraph requires graph-based state management patterns throughout the codebase
- Microsoft Graph API integration requires MSAL authentication
- OneNote API has specific permissions requirements for read/write access

## Notes & Context

### Current Focus
Building a robust foundation for AI agent development with proper Windows tooling and GitHub Copilot integration.

### Key Decisions Made
1. Prioritize Windows/PowerShell compatibility over cross-platform support
2. Use GitHub Copilot as primary AI assistant for development
3. Implement comprehensive testing from the start
4. Follow modern Python packaging and dependency management practices

### Blockers & Dependencies
- Need to research Pydantic AI framework thoroughly before agent implementation
- Require virtual environment setup before package installation
- Must complete project structure before beginning feature development

## Workflow Integration

This task file is integrated with:
- **PLANNING.md**: Overall project architecture and guidelines
- **CLAUDE.md**: AI assistant configuration for project context
- **GitHub Copilot**: Agent mode integration for automated implementation
- **PRPs**: Feature specifications and implementation guidelines

## Maintenance

- Review and update priorities weekly
- Move completed tasks to "Completed Tasks ‚úì" section immediately
- Add new discoveries to "Discovered During Work" section
- Keep daily focus areas updated based on current priorities

## Testing Workflow with TEST_RUN.md

### üö® MANDATORY Test Execution Pattern
**ALL test execution must follow this approach to prevent Copilot Agent from jumping to next commands prematurely:**

#### Required Command
```powershell
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing > TEST_RUN.md 2>&1; Add-Content -Path "TEST_RUN.md" -Value "%TESTS FINISHED%"
```

#### Essential Testing Rules
1. **NEVER run tests without TEST_RUN.md redirection**
2. **ALWAYS wait for `%TESTS FINISHED%` marker** before analyzing results or proceeding
3. **MONITOR TEST_RUN.md contents** to track real-time progress
4. **MAXIMUM wait: 5 minutes** - if tests don't complete, investigate but don't abandon
5. **USE SAME PATTERN for all test types** (unit, integration, coverage)

#### Why This Approach Is Critical
- **Prevents premature actions**: Agent won't move to next step while tests are still running
- **Provides visibility**: Can see test progress as it happens
- **Ensures completion**: Clear marker indicates when tests have finished
- **Debugging aid**: Complete test output captured for failure analysis

#### Testing Validation Checkpoints
- Before any commit or pull request
- After implementing new features
- When fixing bugs or issues
- During PRP validation phases
- After dependency updates

### üóÇÔ∏è File Deletion Protocol
**üö® MANDATORY - NEVER DELETE WITHOUT LOGGING üö®**

#### Before Any File Deletion:
1. **REQUIRED**: Log deletion in `DEL_FILES.md` with full details
2. **Include**: File path, reason, context, date, and your identifier
3. **Template**: Use the standardized format in `DEL_FILES.md`
4. **Verify**: Double-check that deletion is necessary

#### Deletion Entry Requirements:
```markdown
**File Path**: `relative/path/to/file.ext`
- **Reason**: Clear, specific reason for deletion
- **Context**: Background on why file existed and why removing
- **Deleted by**: [Your name or agent identifier]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

#### Critical Benefits:
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of file changes
- **Recovery**: Can restore files if needed later
- **Team Communication**: Others understand what happened
- **Decision Documentation**: Preserves reasoning for future reference
- **Project Evolution**: Track how project structure changes over time

**NO EXCEPTIONS - Always log before deleting!**
