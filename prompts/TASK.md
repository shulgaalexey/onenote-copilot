### July 20, 2025 - API OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Fixed Microsoft Graph API 400 Error for Search and Recent Pages**
  - **Issue**: Search queries and `/recent` command failing with error 400 (code 20266) for accounts with many sections
  - **Root Cause**: Microsoft Graph `/me/onenote/pages` endpoint cannot handle accounts with 40+ sections
  - **Solution**: Enhanced existing fallback mechanisms in search methods to use section-by-section retrieval
  - **Impact**: Both search functionality and recent pages now work correctly for all account sizes
  - **Verification**: Confirmed existing fallback methods were already implemented and working
  - **Files Modified**: Updated `get_recent_pages()` in `src/tools/onenote_search.py` with 400 error handling

## Daily Focus Areas

### Today's Do List
- Complete P-0 tasks (immediate priorities)
- Make progress on P-1 tasks
- Review and update task priorities

### Look Forward To
- Working on P-X tasks (exciting features)
- Experimenting with new AI agent patterns
- Building innovative social interaction features

## Discovered During Work

*Tasks and ideas discovered while working on planned tasks will be added here*

### Research Findings
- **LangGraph vs Pydantic AI**: LangGraph provides better stateful multi-agent capabilities and is more mature for complex workflows. Pydantic AI is simpler but less feature-rich for our OneNote integration needs.
- **OneNote API**: Microsoft Graph API provides comprehensive OneNote access through REST endpoints
- **Windows Development**: PowerShell is the preferred shell, pip is more reliable than uv for package management on Windows
- **Agent Architecture**: Graph-based state management is essential for maintaining context across OneNote operations
- **Package Management**: pip provides better compatibility and is the standard Python package manager

### Technical Discoveries
- PowerShell has different command chaining syntax (`;` instead of `&&`)
- Windows virtual environment activation requires `.ps1` scripts
- LangGraph requires graph-based state management patterns throughout the codebase
- Microsoft Graph API integration requires MSAL authentication
- OneNote API has specific permissions requirements for read/write access

## Testing Workflow with TEST_RUN.md

### üö® MANDATORY Test Execution Pattern
**ALL test execution must follow this approach to prevent Copilot Agent from jumping to next commands prematurely:**

#### Required Command
```powershell
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing > TEST_RUN.md 2>&1; Add-Content -Path "TEST_RUN.md" -Value "%TESTS FINISHED%"
```

#### Essential Testing Rules
1. **NEVER run tests without TEST_RUN.md redirection**
2. **ALWAYS wait for `%TESTS FINISHED%` marker** before analyzing results or proceeding
3. **MONITOR TEST_RUN.md contents** to track real-time progress
4. **MAXIMUM wait: 5 minutes** - if tests don't complete, investigate but don't abandon
5. **USE SAME PATTERN for all test types** (unit, integration, coverage)

<!--  ‚îÄ‚îÄ Test execution rules ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ -->

#### VS Code Task Integration
**When working with GitHub Copilot in VS Code:**
- **ALWAYS** invoke the VS Code task **"pytest (all)"** instead of typing `pytest` in the terminal
- **Wait until that task TERMINATES** (VS Code Tasks API "terminated" event) before you continue with any other action
- **If the task fails**, surface the full task output in chat so I can diagnose it
- **Never start a second long-running task or terminal command** until the current task has finished
- This ensures proper task lifecycle management and prevents resource conflicts

#### Why This Approach Is Critical
- **Prevents premature actions**: Agent won't move to next step while tests are still running
- **Provides visibility**: Can see test progress as it happens
- **Ensures completion**: Clear marker indicates when tests have finished
- **Debugging aid**: Complete test output captured for failure analysis

#### Testing Validation Checkpoints
- Before any commit or pull request
- After implementing new features
- When fixing bugs or issues
- During PRP validation phases
- After dependency updates

### üóÇÔ∏è File Deletion Protocol
**üö® MANDATORY - NEVER DELETE WITHOUT LOGGING üö®**

#### Before Any File Deletion:
1. **REQUIRED**: Log deletion in `DEL_FILES.md` with full details
2. **Include**: File path, reason, context, date, and your identifier
3. **Template**: Use the standardized format in `DEL_FILES.md`
4. **Verify**: Double-check that deletion is necessary

#### Deletion Entry Requirements:
```markdown
**File Path**: `relative/path/to/file.ext`
- **Reason**: Clear, specific reason for deletion
- **Context**: Background on why file existed and why removing
- **Deleted by**: [Your name or agent identifier]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

#### Critical Benefits:
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of file changes
- **Recovery**: Can restore files if needed later
- **Team Communication**: Others understand what happened
- **Decision Documentation**: Preserves reasoning for future reference
- **Project Evolution**: Track how project structure changes over time

**NO EXCEPTIONS - Always log before deleting!**
